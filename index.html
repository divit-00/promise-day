    <h1> Dear Amu 🌹</h1>
    <p>
      As <span class="main">Promise Day</span> dawns upon us,
      I find myself overwhelmed with gratitude for having you in my life.
      With each passing moment, my love for you grows deeper, and my commitment to you strengthens.
      <br><br>
      Today, I promise to stand by your side through thick and thin,
      support your dreams, and cherish every moment we share.
      <br><br>
      I promise to be your rock, your confidant, and your best friend.
      I promise to love you unconditionally, laugh with you in joy,
      and hold you close in sorrow.
      <br><br>
      But above all, I promise to love you fiercely and forever.
      You are my everything.
      <br><br>
      Happy Promise Day, AMU 💖
