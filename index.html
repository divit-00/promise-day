    <h1>Dear Amu ❤️🌹</h1>

    <p>
      As Promise Day dawns, my heart feels full,<br>
      Grateful for you, for this love so beautiful.<br>
      With every moment, my feelings grow strong,<br>
      My soul knows deeper—where I belong.
      <br><br>

      I promise to stand by you, come joy or pain,<br>
      To walk with you through sunshine and rain.<br>
      To believe in your dreams, to cheer you on,<br>
      To cherish every dusk, every dawn.
      <br><br>

      I promise to be your strength when you’re weak,<br>
      Your safest secret, the words you don’t speak.<br>
      To laugh with you loudly in moments of light,<br>
      And hold you closer through the darkest night.
      <br><br>

      Above all promises, this one is true—<br>
      To love you fiercely, forever, just you.<br>
      You’re my always, my heart, my home—<br>
      My everything, wherever we roam.
